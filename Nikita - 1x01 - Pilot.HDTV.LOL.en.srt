Who are you bothering now?

619
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,165
[Chuckles] What,
I can't mingle?

620
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,067
She's been behaving
herself, senator.

621
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,535
I'm sorry, I didn't
get your name.

622
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:24,537
Oh. Nikita.

623
00:35:24,638 --> 00:35:26,339
Beautiful.

624
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,874
Your daughter?

625
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:29,842
Family friend.

626
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,644
Yes. Shall...

627
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,212
I'm sorry.

628
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,234
We better get some
seltzer on that.

629
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:37,409
That's right, that's right.
This way, senator.

630
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:43,656
If you think senator Marcus

631
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,158
is going to be leverage,

632
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,959
he's not.

633
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:48,361
He was just my ticket tonight.

634
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,563
I found out what
escort service he used

635
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:52,665
and I worked it
so I was his date.

636
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,601
Well, you've been planning
this for a while, huh?

637
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:58,804
I want you to know
I can get to you,

638
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,806
and hit you where
it hurts the most.

639
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:03,176
My feelings?
Your funding.

640
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,410
Tonight was just a taste.

641
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:07,713
I'm going to take you apart,
piece by piece,

642
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:10,383
mission by mission.

643
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:14,587
Didn't you accompany me
to one of these once?

644
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,990
Yes.

645
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:19,625
5 years ago.

646
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:22,428
You needed some arm candy
to distract some v.I.P.

647
00:36:22,496 --> 00:36:25,097
I'm surprised
you remember that.

648
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,334
I remember everything.
Ah.

649
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:30,703
Which is why I decided to bring
along a little back-up tonight.

650
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,109
And I'm afraid I'm going to
have to decline your offer.

651
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:41,514
You know this doesn't
have to be awkward.

652
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:45,418
Just take my arm and we'll
go right out that door.

653
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,822
We can do it quiet,
or the other way.

654
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,123
Your choice.

655
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,025
No, Percy, it's yours.

656
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,461
And you just made it.

657
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:56,829
[Beep]

658
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:01,534
[All screaming]

659
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,549
Ah, stay here.

660
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,961
Nikita!

661
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:31,197
[Cocks gun]

662
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,855
Safety on.

663
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,991
Toss it behind you,
don't turn around.

664
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:47,897
Get down on the ground.

665
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:48,765
Slowly.

666
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,067
Spread your arms and your legs.

667
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,671
Just like old times, huh?

668
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,273
Shut up.

669
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,074
You were free.

670
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,376
You had gotten out,
you were gone.

671
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,978
What the hell
are you doing back here?

672
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,880
Someone has to stop Percy.

673
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,682
If Percy goes down,
he has no problem

674
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,083
taking everybody down with him.

675
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,785
This country will not recover.

676
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,086
Do you want that?

677
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,888
What are you talking about?

678
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,091
I'm talking about evidence
of every job Division has had,

679
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,027
locked away in encrypted files,

680
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,095
hidden all over the world.

681
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,931
So he gets a free pass?

682
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,699
Keep training slaves
to kill for him?

683
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,534
Spare me, Nikita.

684
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,436
I know you're in this
for revenge.

685
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,405
You blame me?

686
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,208
You know firsthand
what it feels like.

687
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,810
Have the thing you love most
in life taken away from you.

688
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:38,215
It wasn't your life.
It was your cover.

689
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,451
I warned you not to get
emotionally attached.

690
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,853
You mean the way you did...

691
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,922
With me?

692
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,358
Don't. Don't.

693
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,261
Michael, I know why
you're staying there.

694
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,462
You want to protect
the other recruits

695
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,130
the way you protected me.

696
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,467
I can't protect you anymore.

697
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,638
Then let me go.

698
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,339
Or stop me now.

699
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,582
I'll give you a head start.

700
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,655
If we meet again I can't
promise what will happen.

701
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:24,160
I can.

702
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,269
It's a good wound.
They'll think you tried to stop me.

703
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,004
Just trying to protect you.

704
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,011
Nikita is our new
priority target.

705
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,780
Threat level 6.

706
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,783
Every operative engaged
at that level or lower

707
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,286
will be working on this
full time.

708
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,187
Mike will be heading
the detail.

709
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,025
Amanda will be directing
our overseas assets.

710
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,294
There's really only
a handful of organizations

711
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,295
who could intercept
our intelligence.

712
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,529
Someone is running her,

713
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,697
and I want to know who.

714
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,632
Bring me her head

715
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,601
and bring me all of theirs.

716
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,336
This is war!

717
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,838
Now get to work.

718
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,407
[Door slams]

719
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,862
I'm never gonna get this.

720
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,699
Yeah, someone else
told me that once.

721
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,572
She was wrong, too.

722
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,575
Remember, you're just
getting started.

723
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,383
Damn right.

724
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,308
Here we go.
